# Neutrosophic-Domain-for-Image-Enhancement
This project implements an image enhancement and classification pipeline for leukemia detection using Neutrosophic Image Processing and deep learning. The Neutrosophic domain is applied to enhance medical images by reducing uncertainty, noise, and contrast issues, making cell structures more distinguishable. The enhanced images are then classified using a MobileNetV2-based convolutional neural network (CNN) for efficient and accurate leukemia subtype prediction.

The model is trained and evaluated on the publicly available Leukemia Dataset (Kaggle), achieving high accuracy in distinguishing between different leukemia cell types.

**Key Features:**
1. Image enhancement using Neutrosophic set theory to handle uncertainty and noise in medical data.
2. Transfer learning with MobileNetV2 for lightweight and efficient classification.
3. Achieved improved accuracy compared to baseline CNNs.
4. End-to-end pipeline: preprocessing → enhancement → classification → evaluation.
